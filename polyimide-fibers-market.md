<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyimide Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Spinning</li><li>Dry Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The polyimide fibers market encompasses two primary types of production methods: wet spinning and dry spinning. Wet spinning involves dissolving polyimide in a solvent, creating a solution that is extruded through a spinneret into a coagulation bath, forming fibers. This method generally yields fibers with superior mechanical properties. Conversely, dry spinning involves evaporating the solvent from a spinning solution in a heated chamber, resulting in lightweight fibers. Both methods cater to diverse applications, including aerospace, electronics, and high-temperature insulation.</p></p>

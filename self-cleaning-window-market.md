<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Cleaning Window Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic Coating</li><li>Hydrophobic Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-cleaning window market is primarily segmented into two types based on coating technology: hydrophilic and hydrophobic coatings. Hydrophilic coatings attract water, enabling a thin film to form that helps wash away dirt and grime when it rains. Conversely, hydrophobic coatings repel water, causing it to bead up and roll off, sweeping away contaminants in the process. These technologies enhance convenience and reduce maintenance, making self-cleaning windows increasingly popular in residential and commercial applications.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Glass Epoxy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solventborne</li><li>Waterborne</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Liquid Glass Epoxy market is categorized into two main types: solventborne and waterborne. Solventborne epoxy utilizes organic solvents to dissolve the resin and hardener, offering excellent adhesion and durability, making it suitable for industrial applications. However, it can release volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Conversely, waterborne epoxy relies on water as the primary solvent, resulting in lower VOC emissions and a more environmentally friendly option. This makes waterborne products ideal for residential and commercial applications seeking safer alternatives.</p></p>

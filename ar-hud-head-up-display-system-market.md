<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AR HUD Head-Up Display System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Refractive AR HUD</li><li>Reflective AR HUD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The AR HUD (Head-Up Display) market is primarily divided into two types: Refractive and Reflective AR HUDs. Refractive AR HUDs utilize lenses to bend light, projecting images directly onto the driver's line of sight, enhancing clarity and depth perception. Reflective AR HUDs, on the other hand, use mirrors to reflect images onto a transparent surface, commonly the windshield, allowing for a broader field of view. Both types aim to improve driving safety by providing critical information without diverting attention.</p></p>
